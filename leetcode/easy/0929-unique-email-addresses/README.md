# Unique Email Addresses

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Every  **valid email**  consists of a  **local name**  and a  **domain name**, separated by the `'@'` sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more `'.'` or `'+'`.

- For example, in "alice@leetcode.com", "alice" is the local name, and "leetcode.com" is the domain name.

If you add periods `'.'` between some characters in the  **local name**  part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule  **does not apply**  to  **domain names**.

- For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.

If you add a plus `'+'` in the  **local name**, everything after the first plus sign  **will be ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule  **does not apply**  to  **domain names**.

- For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com".

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given an array of strings `emails` where we send one email to each `emails[i]`, return  *the number of different addresses that actually receive mails*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: emails = ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: emails = ["a@leetcode.com","b@leetcode.com","c@leetcode.com"]
Output: 3

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= emails.length <= 100
- 1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
- emails[i] consist of lowercase English letters, '+', '.' and '@'.
- Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.
- All local and domain names are non-empty.
- Local names do not start with a '+' character.
- Domain names end with the ".com" suffix.
- Domain names must contain at least one character before ".com" suffix.

            local=local.replace(".","");
            set.add(local+"@"+global);
        }
        return set.size();
    }
}
```
