# Removing Stars From a String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in s.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return  *the string after  **all**  stars have been removed*.

 **Note:** 

- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod *e". s becomes "lee* cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee *cod* e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "erase  *"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
- The operation above can be performed on s.

        for(char c: s.toCharArray()) {
            if(c=='*') {
                if(stack.isEmpty()) return "";
                stack.pop();
            } else stack.push(c);
        }
        StringBuilder str=new StringBuilder();
        for(char c: stack)
            str.append(c);
        return str.toString();
    }
}
```
